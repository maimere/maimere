## Hey there! 👋 I'm Pedro Maimere.

Welcome to my little corner of the coding world! I'm a programmer hobbyist based in Brazil 🇧🇷, passionate about exploring technology and building interesting things.

### ⚡ What I'm Enthusiastic About

* **Free libre Software:** I'm a believer in software freedom, aligning with the principles defined by the Free Software Foundation (FSF).
* **The Power of the Shell:** I love digging into shell scripting, finding elegant solutions to automate tasks. I have a particular fondness for the `GNU awk` language!
* **The Gemini Protocol:** Fascinated by the simplicity and potential of the alternative web. Exploring what can be built within its constraints is exciting! 🚀

### 🔭 Current Focus

* **Personal Projects:** My main focus right now is building interactive tools and experiences for my Gemini capsule. You can check it out (if you have a Gemini client!) at: `gemini://maimere.my.id`.
* **Learning Journey:**
    * Diving deeper into the **C programming language** (definitely still learning the ropes!). Kernighan & Ritchie are tutoring me.
    * Continuously trying to improve my **Vi(m) motions** – it feels like a skill you refine forever! ⌨️

### 🤝 How I'm Contributing

* I enjoy giving back to projects I use and appreciate. Currently, I'm contributing **English to Brazilian Portuguese (en->pt_BR) translations** for the **LXQt Project**.
    * You can see the progress and join in here: [LXQt Weblate](https://translate.lxqt-project.org)

Feel free to browse my repositories. While I'm primarily a hobbyist, I approach my projects with curiosity and a desire to learn and build useful things.

Happy coding! 👨🏻‍💻
